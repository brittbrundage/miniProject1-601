**Git Commands**
<br>

- **Repository:** It is a git/file location where all the files are stored.

	- _Example:_ A repository tracks all changes made to file in the project, building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete .git/ folder, then you delete your projects history.

- **Clone (git clone ):** It is a command line utility that is used to target an existing repository and create a clone or copy of the target repository.

	- _Example:_ Make a clone of a repository in a new directory at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine.
