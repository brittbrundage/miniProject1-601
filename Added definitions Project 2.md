**1.	How python uses the Indentation to control Flow**
<br>

Python uses indentation to the control the flow of code. Each block contains a group of code to be run together. Once a 
separate indentation is made, python will read it as a separate group of code. 
Note that the block must all contain the same amount of indentations to be read together.
